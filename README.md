# invoiceform
this is test task

###\#ToDo
* Separate business logic from templates, maybe use Yii/laravel framework. 
* Write some server side validation logic, to make more secure form submitting(needs implementing next step)
* To improve usability, if there is more form like this, we can use angular
* Also styling need improvements, UX and UI redesign, change radio btns to dropdown selectors, etc.
* other improvements concerning business logic needs to be discussed after understanding whole plugin functionality
